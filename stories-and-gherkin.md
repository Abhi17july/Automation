**User Stories**

2. As a user, I want to see the parts related to the selected type from the dropdown so that I can make a selection.
3. As a user, I want to add a part to my cart so that I can review or purchase it later.
4. As a user, I want to navigate to the cart page to see the parts I've added.
5. As a user, I want to remove parts from my cart if I change my mind.
